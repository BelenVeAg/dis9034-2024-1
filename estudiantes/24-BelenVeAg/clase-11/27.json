A loss of sensory function can present as an impairment or complete inability to sense light touch, pressure, heat, pinprick/pain, and proprioception. In these types of spinal cord injury, it is common to have a loss of both sensation and motor control.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Tetraplegia"},{"type":"standard","title":"Spinal_cord_injury","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Spinal cord injury</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q1415275","titles":{"canonical":"Spinal_cord_injury","normalized":"Spinal cord injury","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Spinal cord injury</span>"},"pageid":1053949,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Cervical_Spine_MRI_%28T2W%29.jpg","width":245,"height":289},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Cervical_Spine_MRI_%28T2W%29.jpg","width":245,"height":289},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1224213880","tid":"bf4b816e-13d9-11ef-9515-c38c9f708d0a","timestamp":"2024-05-16T23:12:21Z","description":"Injury to the main nerve bundle in the back of humans","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spinal_cord_injury"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Spinal_cord_injury","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spinal_cord_injury"}},"extract":"A spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that causes temporary or permanent changes in its function.

Once a bustling industrial center, like many cities in the Rust Belt, East St. Louis was severely affected by the loss of jobs due to the flight of the population to the suburbs during the riots of the late 1960s. In 1950, East St. Louis was the fourth-largest city in Illinois when its population peaked at 82,366. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 18,469, less than one-quarter of the 1950 census and a decline of almost one third since 2010.</p>","normalizedtitle":"East St. Louis, Illinois"}],"year":1896},{"text":"War of 1812: The troops of the U.S. Army and vessels of the U.S. Navy cooperated in a successful amphibious assault to capture Fort George in Upper Canada.","pages":[{"type":"standard","title":"War_of_1812","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">War of 1812</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q26013","titles":{"canonical":"War_of_1812","normalized":"War of 1812","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">War of 1812</span>"},"pageid":34059,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/War_of_1812_Montage.jpg/320px-War_of_1812_Montage.jpg","width":320,"height":476},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/War_of_1812_Montage.jpg","width":1144,"height":1700},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1225363372","tid":"dbae7610-195f-11ef-984c-22332063f575","timestamp":"2024-05-23T23:54:57Z","description":"1812–1815 conflict in North America","description_source":"local","content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:War_of_1812"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/War_of_1812","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:War_of_1812"}},"extract":"The War of 1812 was fought by the United States and its allies against the United Kingdom and its allies in North America.

The small town of Winterthur lies 18 kilometers (11 mi) northeast of Zürich, in Switzerland. Because of its position at the junction of seven roads, the army that held the town controlled access to most of Switzerland and points crossing the Rhine into southern Germany. Although the forces involved were small, the ability of the Austrians to sustain their 11-hour assault on the French line resulted in the consolidation of three Austrian forces on the plateau north of Zürich, leading to the French defeat a few days later.</p>","normalizedtitle":"Battle of Winterthur"},{"type":"standard","title":"Winterthur","displaytitle":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Winterthur</span>","namespace":{"id":0,"text":""},"wikibase_item":"Q9125","titles":{"canonical":"Winterthur","normalized":"Winterthur","display":"<span class=\"mw-page-title-main\">Winterthur</span>"},"pageid":502113,"thumbnail":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Blick_auf_die_Winterthurer_Altstadt.jpg/320px-Blick_auf_die_Winterthurer_Altstadt.jpg","width":320,"height":214},"originalimage":{"source":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Blick_auf_die_Winterthurer_Altstadt.jpg","width":3600,"height":2402},"lang":"en","dir":"ltr","revision":"1215044072","tid":"02c8ba4f-e887-11ee-92a0-566180c06239","timestamp":"2024-03-22T20:01:46Z","description":"City in the canton of Zürich, Switzerland","description_source":"local","coordinates":{"lat":47.49888889,"lon":8.72861111},"content_urls":{"desktop":{"page":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterthur","revisions":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterthur?action=history","edit":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterthur?action=edit","talk":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Winterthur"},"mobile":{"page":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterthur","revisions":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:History/Winterthur","edit":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterthur?action=edit","talk":"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Winterthur"}},"extract":"Winterthur is a city in the canton of Zürich in northern Switzerland.
